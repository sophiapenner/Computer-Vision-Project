# Computer-Vision-Project
The objective of this machine vision project is to create an automated “Waldo Detector” using image processing techniques discussed in Mech450F lectures. The techniques will be applied in a MATLAB function. The function will load three images and return them with Waldo detected and marked with a rectangle.
